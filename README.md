Here are some interview questions on Operating System topics related to Virtual Memory, Page Replacement Algorithms, Demand Paging, and Thrashing:

1. **Virtual Memory**:
   - Explain the concept of virtual memory and its advantages.
   - How does virtual memory differ from physical memory? 
   - Describe the role of the page table in virtual memory management.
   - What is address translation in the context of virtual memory?
   - Can you discuss the implementation of demand paging in virtual memory systems?

2. **Page Replacement Algorithms**:
   - What are page replacement algorithms, and why are they necessary?
   - Compare and contrast FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms.
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each page replacement algorithm.
   - How does the Clock (or Second-Chance) page replacement algorithm work?
   - Can you explain the working principles of the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm?

3. **Demand Paging**:
   - Define demand paging and explain its significance in virtual memory systems.
   - What are the steps involved in handling a page fault in demand paging?
   - Discuss the benefits and challenges of demand paging compared to pre-paging.
   - How does demand paging improve memory utilization and system performance?
   - Can you explain how thrashing is related to demand paging, and how it can be mitigated?

4. **Thrashing**:
   - What is thrashing, and what are its causes in virtual memory systems?
   - How can the operating system detect thrashing, and what actions can it take to alleviate it?
   - Discuss the relationship between thrashing and the concept of working set.
   - Can you explain the role of page fault rate in identifying thrashing?
   - Describe some strategies to prevent or reduce thrashing in an operating system.
